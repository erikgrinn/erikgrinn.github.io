This course was, as expected, a very introductory level intro to computer science using Python.
All the material is designated as private due to academic policy, so there is nothing to showcase here.
However, the course provided a formal, structured way to learn the basics of Python, culminating in a "streaming guide"
that tested our comprehension of class comprehension. Check other classes for more info including portfolio projects!
