## AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

I recently completed the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge - a hands-on project that combines web development with cloud infrastructure. The challenge involves building a personal resume website using various AWS services.

### What I Built:
- **Static Website**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript hosted on S3
- **CDN**: CloudFront distribution for secure global content delivery
- **API**: API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function
- **Lambda**: Lambda function to increment and return the number of visits from the database
- **Database**: DynamoDB to store visit counts
- **Infrastructure as Code**: CloudFormation templates using YAML and SAM CLI
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

### Key Takeaways:
This project was an excellent introduction to AWS services and serverless architecture. It demonstrated how modern web applications can leverage cloud services for scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness.
The visitor counter functionality required integrating multiple AWS services, giving me hands-on experience with the AWS ecosystem. Setting up the CI/CD pipeline taught me about automation and best practices for cloud deployments.
Perfect practice for anyone looking to get started with AWS and cloud development!
