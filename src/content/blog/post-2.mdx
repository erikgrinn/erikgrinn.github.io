In comes CSS. Styling a webpage seems to be important.

This project is a simple landing page created as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It demonstrates various key coding concepts and techniques in HTML and CSS.

## Key Coding Concepts

### HTML Structure
- **Semantic HTML**: The project uses semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<div>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` to structure the content meaningfully.
- **Responsive Design**: The HTML includes meta tags to ensure the page is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

### CSS Styling
- **Flexbox**: The layout is primarily managed using CSS Flexbox, which allows for flexible and responsive design. Key properties include `display: flex`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`.
- **Custom Fonts**: The project imports and uses the "Roboto" font from Google Fonts to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Button Styling**: Custom styles are applied to buttons, including border-radius, background color, padding, and text color.
- **Color Scheme**: The project uses a consistent color scheme with specific colors for background, text, and buttons to maintain visual coherence.
- **Box Model**: Proper use of padding, margin, and border properties to create spacing and alignment.
- **Media Queries**: Although not explicitly used in the current CSS, the project is designed to be easily extendable with media queries for further responsiveness.

### Images
- **Image Embedding**: The project includes images using the `<img>` tag with appropriate `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` attributes to ensure accessibility and proper display.

### Typography
- **Font Sizes and Weights**: Different font sizes and weights are used to create a visual hierarchy and improve readability.
- **Text Alignment**: Text alignment properties are used to center and justify text content appropriately.

### Miscellaneous
- **CSS Comments**: Comments are used in the CSS file to explain the purpose of specific styles and sections.
- **HTML Comments**: HTML comments are used to provide context and structure within the HTML file.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the landing page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the landing page.
- `images/`: A directory containing image assets used in the project.
