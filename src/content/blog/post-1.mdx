My first public website utilizing basic HTML was a list of three recipes. No CSS. No JavaScript. No React. Every list item painstakingly manufactured for each item.

This project is a simple recipe website created as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It demonstrates basic HTML structure and concepts. Below are the key coding concepts used in this project:

## Key Coding Concepts

### HTML Structure
- **DOCTYPE Declaration**: Specifies the HTML version and helps browsers render the page correctly.
- **HTML Tags**: Used to create the structure of the web pages, including headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`), and links (`<a>`).
- **Head and Body Sections**: The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, while the `<body>` section contains the content that is displayed to the user.

### Links and Navigation
- **Anchor Tags (`<a>`)**: Used to create hyperlinks that navigate between different pages of the website.
- **Relative Paths**: Used in the `href` attribute of anchor tags to link to other pages and images within the project directory.

### Images
- **Image Tags (`<img>`)**: Used to display images on the web pages. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image file, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image.

### Lists
- **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)**: Used to create bullet point lists.
- **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)**: Used to create numbered lists.
- **List Items (`<li>`)**: Used to define individual items within both unordered and ordered lists.

### Semantic HTML
- **Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`)**: Used to define headings and subheadings, which help structure the content and improve accessibility.
- **Paragraphs (`<p>`)**: Used to define blocks of text.

### Comments
- **HTML Comments (`<!-- -->`)**: Used to add comments within the HTML code that are not displayed to the user. These are useful for documentation and code organization.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main page of the website that links to individual recipe pages.
- **recipes/**: A directory containing individual HTML files for each recipe.
- **images/**: A directory containing image files used in the project.

## How to View the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the main page.
3. Navigate through the recipe links to view individual recipe pages.

This project serves as a foundational exercise in understanding and applying basic HTML concepts to create a simple, multi-page website.
