Practice with CSS grid, as opposed to main use of flex up to now. Both are great tools, and this was a good example of how grid can be beneficial when the layout is known in advance.

## Key Coding Concepts

### HTML
- **Semantic HTML**: The project uses semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<div>`, and `<ul>` to structure the content meaningfully.
- **External Resources**: The project links external CSS and JavaScript files using `<link>` and `<script>` tags.

### CSS
- **Grid Layout**: The project uses CSS Grid Layout to create a responsive and flexible layout for the dashboard.
- **Flexbox**: Flexbox is used for aligning items within containers, such as in the `.search`, `.profile`, and `.buttons` classes.
- **Custom Fonts**: Google Fonts are imported and used to style the text.
- **Hover Effects**: CSS hover effects are applied to list items and project cards to enhance user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: The CSS ensures that the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

### Images and Icons
- **SVG Icons**: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) icons are used for various elements like the sidebar and project links.
- **PNG Images**: PNG images are used for profile pictures and other graphical elements.

### Project Structure
- **Modular Design**: The project is organized into separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, promoting modularity and maintainability.
- **File Organization**: Icons and images are stored in a dedicated `icons` directory, keeping the project directory clean and organized.

### Accessibility
- **Alt Attributes**: Images and icons include `alt` attributes to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: The project ensures that interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.

### Performance
- **Optimized Images**: Using SVG icons and optimized PNG images helps in reducing the load time and improving performance.

These concepts collectively contribute to creating a well-structured, maintainable, and user-friendly admin dashboard.
